          <p>The impact of extremely rare and almost completely unexpected events (called “<em>Black Swans</em>”) is
            often underestimated, and plans to mitigate or repair their damage upon public infrastructure are often
            outdated or even non-existent. In many instances where catastrophes cause unprecedented damage to lives and
            property, it is often realized after the fact that most decision-makers did not even consider the
            possibility of such an event happening. The impact of these events is magnified due to the completely
            unprepared nature of its victims. One case in point is the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami which had a death toll
            of almost 240,000. Previous such events in the same region were in 1883 and 1400 and these had catastrophic
            casualties as well. The vast majority of people as well as decision-makers in some heavily-hit regions did
            not even know that tsunamis were a thing, let alone advocate preparative measures for one.
          </p>
          <p>Policy discussions, decision-making, regulations and preparedness measures against disasters often center
            around:</p>
          <ul class="check-list">
            <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> <b>Individual buildings:</b>&nbsp; Building codes,
              strengthened materials, better structural design, evacuation drills
            </li>
            <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> <b>Intra-city first response:</b>&nbsp; Removing
              encroachments on critical roads, funding for local first responders.
            </li>
            <li><i class="ion-android-checkmark-circle"></i> <b>Prediction:</b>&nbsp; Tsunami warning systems, better
              weather satellites, weather prediction models.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>However, when the public recovery infrastructure of an entire city is put out of action, which is often the
            case with extremely powerful disasters, help has to arrive from outside. This cannot happen in volume if the
            city is disconnected from all inter-city transportation networks.</p>
          <p>Our project makes a <b>post-facto</b> study of the impact that such disasters can have on road connectivity
            by building road network graphs from datasets and running Monte-Carlo simulations to measure the
            vulnerability of each city to being unreachable in the aftermath of a disaster.</p>

            on water, gas, electricity and roads. Their focus is on building logistical plans for distributing food,
            water and medicines, as well as supporting the civilian population in temporary shelters until recovery.
            They attempt to estimate how many trucks, drivers, the quantity of fuel and the number of operational hours
            required to restore normalcy in the aftermath of the disaster. They compare the existing response plan with
            their proposed plan which they obtain by setting up an optimization problem. However, their road network

            <p>Our goal is to generate a tiled map of California along with the set of road segments each tile contains.
              We generate this view by first drawing uniformly dividing California into 1km x 1km tiles. After that, we
              create a representation of the set of all tiles and store:</p>
            <p>
            <ul>

            </ul>
            </p>
            <p>An obvious, but clever optimization that we did was to not store any information about tiles that do not
              contain any roads, bringing down the number of tiles by 96%.</p>

              Start node ID, end node ID and edge ID.

            <p>Each node v in this view contains:</p>
            <p>
            <ol>

            </ol>

            <p>Each edge (u, v) in this view represents a road directly connecting u to v without going through any
              other settlement. As useful auxiliary information, we store the IDs of the road segments that make up this
              road.</p>
            <p>We construct this view by starting with the Segment view and following the below algorithm:</p>
            <p>
            <ol>
              <li class="border-0">Attach all segment nodes within a 2km radius of each city to that city.</li>
              <li class="border-0">Recursively merge pairs of road nodes A and B if B has a degree <= 2. This eliminates
                irrelevant nodes and reduces the number of nodes from 18668 to 2276.
              </li>
              <li class="border-0">For each settlement, find out whether there is a direct link to another settlement
                through the reduced set of road nodes. If so, the settlements are directly connected.
              </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>We distributed the computation required across 5 machines and it took 3 hours to build the above graph.
              We obtained a graph with 1505 cities and 6522 direct roads between them.</p>

              <h2>Modeling Earthquakes</h2>
              <p>Earthquakes are represented as a Gaussian-like function centered at a geo-coordinate. We assume that
                the intensity of the earthquake at its epicenter is <code>I0</code>. This earthquake has a particular
                decay radius <code>R</code>. This radius controls how rapidly the impact of the earthquake decays from
                the center. Mathematically, the intensity at a point <code>(x, y)</code> is given by:

                <br>
                <br>
                The intensity function has an exponential decay which fits perfectly in simulating an earthquake since
                Richter scale, the most common standard of measurement of an earthquake, is logarithmic.

              <p>A hurricane is represented as a maximal mixture of Gaussian-like functions interpolated along the path

                <code>start_intensity</code>, <code>end_radius</code> and <code>end_intensity</code>. We draw
                Gaussian-like functions all along the path, and the standard deviation as well as the multiplicative
                factor for the Gaussian are given by interpolating the relevant start and end parameters. We support
                straight paths and linear interpolation for the intensities and radii. Mathematically, the following
                expression gives the intensity of the hurricane at every point:

              <h5>Segment/City Damage Probability</h5>
              <p>The probability that a segment or city can be damaged depends on the intensity of the disaster at that
                point as well as the nature of the disaster. In line with previous work, we use a logistic regression
                model to estimate this probability. The intensity is related to the probability of damage as:

                <br><br>
                <p>The parameters μ and χ allow us to encode a lot of intuition and external knowledge into the
                  model:
                <ol>
                  <li>μ, the Quality Bias, allows us to specify how resistant a particular road segment or city is to
                    damage in general. In the future, we can be cognizant of the fact that different road segments were
                    built with different technologies and have different age/pre-existing damage and thus have different
                    levels of vulnerability to damage.
                  </li>
                  <li>χ, the Susceptibility Factor, allows us to specify how strongly the intensity of the disaster
                    is related to the probability of damage. This allows us to generalize the model to several different
                    kinds of disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, nuclear explosions, etc. which have different
                    scales to measure them as well as different effects on infrastructure.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                </p>
                <p class="m-0">The parameters were chosen to match expected damage levels from specific intensity values
                  for earthquakes and hurricanes. We expect a magnitude 9 earthquake to cause widespread destruction
                  while a magnitude 7 earthquake is nearly harmless to modern structures.</p>

            <div class="wow fadeInRight">
              <h5>Correlations in nearby damage</h5>
              <p>We are currently assuming that given all the intensities at each point on the map, the probability that
                a city or road segment is damaged is independent of whether or not a neighboring region is damaged. This
                is very similar to the Naive Bayes assumption that is often made in classification models. This allows
                us to treat each segment and city as an independent Bernoulli random variable and sample from that
                distribution.</p>
              <p>In truth, roads being solid structures, stresses and shears exerted on one segment of a road will
                propagate to neighboring sections as well, leading to conditional dependence. A solution is to use more
                complex models like the

              <h2>Modeling Risk</h2>
              <p>Given a particular state of the network where some road segments and cities are damaged, we need to
                identify which settlements that require help are now cut off from aid. We do this through the following
                model:</p>
              <p>In the aftermath of a disaster, certain well-equipped settlements must take on the role of <b><em>Relief
                Hubs</em></b> and render assistance to settlements through <b><em>undamaged</em></b> roads. We assume
                that relief hubs are those settlements which are undamaged and have a population of more than 250,000.
                After identifying the relief hubs, the process that we follow is:</p>
              <p>
              <ol>
                <li>For every settlement, use Dijsktra’s Algorithm to find out the nearest relief hub.</li>
                <li> If there is no access to a relief hub at all, declare the settlement to be <em>unreachable</em>,
                  thus setting the <em>reachability</em> value to 0.
                </li>
                <li>If the nearest hub is more than 700km away, declare the settlement to be unreachable, thus setting
                  the reachability to 0.
                </li>
                <li>All other cases imply that the settlement is still connected to the road network, thereby causing
                  its reachability to be 1.
                </li>
              </ol>
              </p>
              <p>Settlements that are repeatedly unreachable for several realizations of a particular disaster are
                vulnerable to that disaster. This leads us to the next section where we produce these several
                realizations.</p>

            <p>Our goal, given a disaster with a specific set of parameters, is to use the above described probability
              models to calculate the probability that a city is cut off from all external aid due to that disaster. We
              cannot calculate this analytically as the relationships are too complicated to allow tractable analysis.
              In such a case, a standard solution is Monte Carlo simulation. Given a disaster, the simulation proceeds
              as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>Calculate the intensities at every point using the disaster model. Calculate the road segment and city
                damage probabilities at every point using the damage model.
              </li>
              <li>Sample a particular realization of the damage from these probabilities under the independence
                assumption stated earlier. This gives us a set of damaged roads and cities.
              </li>
              <li>For every city, calculate the reachability metric using Dijkstra’s algorithm and the subsequent
                conditions defined above.
              </li>
              <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 for many independent iterations, then take the average reachability value for
                each city.
              </li>
              <li>The risk/vulnerability for a city is 1 - average_reachability.</li>

            <p class="description m-0">For the same disaster, different cities and network structures display very
              different risk metrics, and the patterns are in line with probabilistic graphical intuition.
              <br>
              Consider an example where we simulate a hurricane that starts near LA and heads beyond the Bay Area.
              <br>
              The hurricane exerts peak magnitude along its spine and becomes weaker as we move away to the edges, as we
              discussed in the disaster modeling earlier.
              <br>
              Despite the intensity being near-identical in the Bay Area and in the LA area, we'll find the risks to be
              very distinct!

            <p class="description m-0">The Bay Area has numerous settlements that depend on a single road, and also has
              several risky settlements that can easily be cutoff from external relief. This illustrates the fact that
              “bus” or “path” networks are highly vulnerable to disconnection. Some isolated settlements (San Jose,
              Sacramento) have high connectivity in <b>diverse</b> directions and are risk-free.
              <br>San Francisco does have 3 roads leading out, but two of those roads funnel very closely together into
              the path of the hurricane and are thus both put out of action. This is very likely in real scenario as
              well.

            </div>
            <p class="description m-0">LA and its surrounding cities lie on a highly interconnected grid, and their
              risks are very low despite the equally high magnitude of the disaster. Grid structures are resilient to
              disruption due to the high amount of built-in redundancy - for every interior node, four edges must be
              removed to disconnect that node. We also notice that a few grid corners that have only two edges also have
              elevated vulnerability.
              <br>
              Triangular structures, while not as expensive as grid structures still provide some amount of resiliency
              since two neighboring nodes must be removed to disconnect the graph.

            <p>Our specific example shows that much of the Bay Area is very vulnerable to being isolated in case of a
              disaster of catastrophic disaster, although such a disaster by itself may seem unlikely. Further research
              along two completely independent paths is required to
            <ol>
              <li>Improve the accuracy of our simulation process by reducing some of the more general assumptions
                (uniform road quality, oversimplified disaster models) to make a stronger argument in favor of risk
                mitigation procedures that require possibly expensive public infrastructure projects.
              </li>
              <li>Propose optimal changes to the transport network structure that best eliminate risk while still being
                socially and politically viable.
              </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>From a technical standpoint, It is very interesting to see how disaster models and independence
              assumptions (think back to the massless pulleys, inextensible strings, incompressible fluids, spherical
              cows, point masses and all the outrageous things that we saw in high school physics) that are extremely
              simple when applied to real-life network data still manage to produce useful insights that are well
              aligned with our intuition on network resilience.</p>

              <li class="border-0">Roads are not treated differently according to their different real-life qualities.
                The helpful presence of the quality bias factor in the damage model can allow us to introduce this
                variation into the simulation. We will also have to move to more informative road datasets such as
                OpenStreetMaps to derive this data.
              </li>
              <li class="border-0">We are working on a very limited region, that of the California. Obviously, cities
                from neighboring states will also assist in case of a catastrophe, thus reducing the vulnerability of
                cities like Los Angeles.

            <p>
            <ol>
              <li class="border-0">Some previous research into the logistical side of post-event planning has considered
                deep factors like the volume of relief material required, the number of drivers, trucks, fuels, routing
                plans, etc. While this kind of low-level planning with insufficiently detailed computer models might end
                up with fragile “paper plans” that don’t really extend to the diverse range of situations that could
                manifest in the real world, they do point to the need to consider the widely varying needs of different
                cities in the aftermath of a disaster in terms of the volume of relief material they require as well as
                the variations in logistical challenges between different cities.
              </li>
              <li class="border-0">Our disaster models, as well as our damage models, could use improvements. We are
                basing them on existing research, which by itself is quite sparse, so we could, with the assistance of
                subject experts, use more informed models. One example is to use a correlated damage model for the roads
                where the probability of a road segment being damaged has a conditional dependence on its neighbor being
                damaged (we are assuming conditional independence given the disaster magnitude at that point).

              <li class="border-0">From an implementation standpoint, our simulation code is currently single-thread,
                single-machine, so it is not easily scalable to larger regions of interest. We should switch to using
                Pregel or other distributed graph libraries so that we can look at inter-state or even international
                assistance routes.
